SIMPLOO - The simple lua object-oriented programming library!
=====

#### Introduction

SIMPLOO is a library designed to simplify object-oriented programming in lua.

#### Features

** Quick Feature Overview **

* public/protected/private access modifiers
* abstract/static/constant class members
* constructors/finalizers
* multiple inheritance
* common OOP functions such as get\_name(), is\_a(), instance\_of() and child\_of()
* build in registry that ensures iteration free member access.
* metamethod support

#### Additional Notes

* This library uses the following globals: SIMPLOO, null, class, extends, options, public, protected, private, static, abstract, meta, const
* There are no guarantees that this library behaves exactly like other object oriented programming languages.

#### Requirements

This library is being developed and tested on LuaJIT 2.1.0 (Lua 5.1) and Lua 5.2.
For the best performance I recommend using a LuaJIT environment.

#### Installation

Simply include the simploo.lua file in the beginning of your code and you're ready to go!
